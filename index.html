  <h1>Laura White</h1>
  <p>I have worked for the last nine years at Aisle Rocket Studios, where each day is a little bit different and brings a unique set of marketing challenges to solve. One week, I’ll write training articles to educate Sears sales associates on the latest Maytag laundry pairs, undertake a re-branding initiative for a group of Catholic schools, train junior copywriters on SEO best practices, and brainstorm theme names for a joint event between Lowes and Whirlpool. And the following week?  I’ll write product descriptions for Kimberly-Clark with HTML code, B2C emails for Kmart, and build a site map for an e-commerce website. With nine years of ad agency experience, I intuitively know what to do when a new creative brief lands in my inbox.</p>
